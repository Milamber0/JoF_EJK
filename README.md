This is the JoF EternalJK Client which focuses on providing a safe client option for JoF Members, friends and others to use.

It was based on an [![Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/repository-EternalJK-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/eternalcodes/EternalJK) version given to us by [Bucky](https://github.com/Bucky21659) with the promise of not sharing some code that was protected by the TECH definition. This is the version of the repo with all of that TECH code removed, and will be where continued development will happen.
